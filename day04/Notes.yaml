Introduction to Playwright

CDP - Chrome DevTools Protocols

Key/Core Components of Playwright
1. Browser instance - copy of the browser (browser)
2. Browser Context - an isolated environment within the browser instance
                   - akin to incognito session
                   - operate independently with its own cookies, local storage, and cache
                   - making it possible to run tests in parallel without any shared state
3. Page - an individual tab or a window within the browser context
        - helps to interact with the web elements

Single browser instance --> multiple browser contexts
      Single browser contexts --> multiple pages

To create a Playwright test file - use the extension - filename.spec.ts
To run the test file - npx playwright test filename.spec.ts
To open the html report - npx playwright show-report

Default mode - headless
Three levels of configurations
  1. CLI - highest priority
  2. Test level configuration - higher than the config.ts file
  3. playwright.config.ts (default configurations) - least priority
